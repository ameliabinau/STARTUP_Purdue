# Welcome to STARTUP: Summer Training in Applied Research Tools for Undergraduate Physics

Having seen a growing need within the the field to provide experience and training in physics research to curious and ambitious students, we developed STARTUP to provide all who are interested with meaningful, one-on-one experience.

**What is STARTUP?**

STARTUP, having run for 11 weeks, is designed to expose students to the wide variety of open-source research tools that are widely used in modern computational physics research. This coding-heavy, independent, entirly-online course emphasized important packages and platforms student could access on their own to build marketable skills in the field(s) of their choosing and explore their own research interests independently. 

Entirely student-led, powered, and inspired. Coding-heavy. Commitment-heavy. STARTUP is a fast-paced survey program of modern research skills that must be developed in order to pursue a variety of research projects across a variety of fields. The goal of the program is to provide students a one-on-one opportunity to learn under senior undergraduate and graduate researchers in a variety of fields. STARTUP is a chance to develop a personal project and experience with software/simulations/real data that are marketable to internships, labs, and graduate school. 

STARTUP is not funded, affiliated with, or managed by the Purdue Department of Physics and Astronomy; it is an entirely independent pursuit and there not an *official* research program. All instruction is conducted in a 11-week online crash course.
