# Welcome to STARTUP: Summer Training in Applied Research Tools for Undergraduate Physics

Having seen a growing need within the the field to provide experience and training in physics research to curious and ambitious students, we developed STARTUP to provide all who are interested with meaningful, one-on-one experience.

STARTUP, having run for 11 weeks, was designed to expose students to the wide variety of open-source research tools that are widely used in modern computational physics research. This coding-heavy, independent, entirly-online course emphasized important packages and platforms student could access on their own to build marketable skills in the field(s) of their choosing and explore their own research interests independently.
