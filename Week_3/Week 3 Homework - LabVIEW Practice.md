# Week 3 Homework - LabVIEW Practice 

LabVIEW is a software that allows for control, measurement, and manipulation of signals/data from hardware in a lab. It can also be used to program mathematical calculations and other logical flows. LabVIEW programs can be found in just about every experimental physics lab as it serves as an easy "integrator" for instrument measurements.

LabVIEW (created by National Instruments, NI) uses a "visual" programming language called G and is coded in various C languages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW). There is a "front end" (or "front panel") to the software, where displays of information (plots, "lights" signifying binary signals, switches, buttons, numeric displays, etc.) can be created that show the status of data as it's being manipulated in the "back end" or "block diagram" of the program. 

Download LabVIEW (https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview-student-software-suite.html#352828) from NI. You automatically get a 45 day trial of the software. You'll have to create a NI account using your Purdue email. Once this is done and you verify your account via email, you begin the download of the LabVIEW suite. They will ask if you want to disable Windows Fast Startup; click no. Additionally, you don't want yo install any of the packages for LabVIEW and the program might take around 10 minutes to install. After it installs, your computer will restart. Launch LabVIEW when complete and click "Create Project" and "Create New VI." Every project will be called a "VI," or "Virtual Instrument."

Activity 1: 

Explore the "Functions" window. Name three functions from three major categories (drop-down boxes) and describe what they are used for. You can do a little research for this.
